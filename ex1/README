Q1:
This is our answer for the first assignment in the exercise - understanding wht the file "WhatIDo"
does using strace:
First when trying to simply run the program, we encountered an error message stating that the
program expects an argument. after we provided an argument the program ran successfully.

Right after the lines in the output of strace that describe the loading of the program, we start to
see system calls made by the "actual body" of the program.
From them we can see that the program does the following:
1. creating a new directory called "Welcome" (using mkdir).
2. creating a new directory called "To" inside "Welcome" (using mkdir).
3. opening a new file called "OS2021" in "Welcome/To" (using openat).
4. getting the file status using fstat.
5. writing to the new file 3 lines (using write):
   "<the user name of the user who ran the program>"
   "If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!"
   "<the argument provided when running the program>"
6. closing the file (using close).
7. deleting the file (using unlink).
8. deleting the directory "To" (using rmdir).
9. deleting the directory "Welcome" (using rmdir).

Essentially, the program creates directories and file, writes to the file and than immediately
deletes them all. So "to the naked eye" it appears as if nothing happened, but when examining the
system calls made by the program we see everything that was described above.
